I've been waiting to do this post until I had a couple months with the iPhone, so any pizzazz of having a new phone could wear off.

### Battery Life

The battery life didn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. The iPhone 6 easily lasts through my typical workday. The usual things eat up my battery life, in my iPhone or Android - games and Google Maps.

Android users often brag about removable battery (never mind the fact that Google's own Nexus brand doesn't have this nifty feature), but I'll be honest: in my entire tenure of Samsung phones (4+ years) I've never swapped out the battery for another fully charged one.

This feature, while potentially useful, is just not something that the average user needs. Perhaps certain niche outdoors people would find this useful, but I think Apple made the right choice in optimizing for the general use case.

### Google Apps

Without a doubt, google apps are significantly better experience on Android than on iPhone - GMail most of all, thought Google Maps is a particular painpoint as well. This is probably the only set of applications that I use on a regular basis that are better on Android than on iPhone.

Although this is true, I find that the design of these same Google apps is sufficient to get the job done. Overall, it accomplishes its mission well enoguh that this really isn't a very large problem at all.

### Apps in General

It's been flaunted about in every WWDC conference, and it's true: apps are better in general on iPhone than Android. They are better designed, new features come out on iOS first, and they provide more seamless experiences.

The lack of true multitasking has really not hampered my usage of the phone at all. To put it another way: if the phone doesn't have to multitask, it can focus all of its CPU on the app, making the experience far better.

### Design

It's not even a question, really. Apple hails design as its chief forte, and in this aspect, the iPhone was undoubtedly better designed than most Android phones I've seen. It's not exactly that Android phones can never compete with Apple. But out of the box, without any effort at all, Apple gave a gorgeous design to most users.

With my Android I've have to spend days, perhaps weeks, configuring every little thing to find a design I could like. And this could be a good thing for many hackers - people who like to tinker with their devices revel in the freedom to be able to do so.

But for me, I didn't want to spend so much time configuring my phone. Between a home theater, game consoles, my desktop and laptop, I just feel that there's more than enough tinkering to be done.

One final anecdote about how much thought went into the design of this particular technology. My friend interned at Apple, and this story was shamelessly stolen from him.

When the iPhone 5 was first being designed, they found that the number of times it was taken in and out of pant pockets highly correlated with the amount of lint accumulated. Turns out, it was the holes needed for the speakers. They were so sharp that they would often make tiny cuts to the pant pockets. Because of this, Apple spent two months sanding the insides of the holes to make them curves intead of jagged metal.

This was a tiny change that, honestly, most people wouldn't have even bothered to notice. After all, everyone's pant pockets get linty from time to time, right?

There's great design, and then there's Apple.

### Storage

Between the limited storage and lack of external storage capabilities, many people's chief concern with the iPhone is storage.

Given how many other phones are also adapting this feature (Galaxy S6, Nexus line, and many others), I'd say Apple probably made the correct tradeoff. I'm not sure what the hardware constraints were, but I'm sure they had a good reason.

This might be a bigger problem for many people who store music from iTunes and other things, but I stream all my media from various internet services, so I'm quite happy with my 16GB iPhone. I use it for various games, and perhaps a handful of songs, but overall it's got plenty of space for my limited needs.

### Conclusion

Overall, I'm very happy I switched to the iPhone, and I'll probably stay with Apple in the future, barring significant advancements in Android.

There are many very useful features, like the international keyboards, with which Apple has done a remarkable job.

Given how quickly Android is closing the gap, it's no wonder that the Android/iOS fan wars rage hotter than ever.

I do think that, if only many of the hardcore fans used the other phone for a couple months, they'd see that the issues most people think are huge are often not relevant for most people's use cases.
