I went axe throwing! [Bad Axe Throwing](https://badaxethrowing.com/locations/axe-throwing-san-francisco/) in Daly City is the closest if you're near SF, and it's _really_ fun. By this point in the pandemic we've all been through the Among Us stage, the bread baking stage, the interior decoration stage, and so many others. So now we're ready to go out with friends again, but I was looking for some new activities - ideally one that you can get reasonably proficient at in an hour. I find axe throwing to be perfect for this.

It's amazing how _bad_ you are when you first start, and how reasonably good you are in just an hour with some minor coaching. Bad Axe Throwing split our session up into two parts - first just to pick your form and gain consistency. Do you throw one handed or two? Left or right hand? One or two steps before the throw? Once you spend an hour getting consistant (and you will get remarkably consistant in just an hour), the second phase was games.

Take a bull's eye board and assign points to various zones, have the teams compete, etc. Overall it was super fun and not something many people do an a daily basis, so if you have a chance definitely go for it. Just remember no sandals!
