I had a chance to stay in the [number 1 most visited Airbnb in the world](https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a26989918/most-popular-airbnb-mushroom-dome-california/), and _boy_ did it live up to the hype. In case you weren't aware, in a quiet suburb of Santa Cruz is the [Mushroom Dome](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8357?source_impression_id=p3_1631070541_1%2Bd4KgzpkZTP%2B%2FYt). Run by an incredibly adorable couple (Michael and Kitty), the Mushroom Dome is a super cute, tranquil retreat from the chaos of daily life. We chose to go there during the height of the pandemic, just to get away from everything for a couple days. Within hours I forgot what day of the week it was and just settled in. There's something magical about living in a tiny space where there's _no_ excess. Every piece of furniture will be used every day, and every item is chosen with care.

The fridge is well stocked with many vegan options, and unlike those awful hotel bars, everything is included in the price of the Airbnb! I helped myself to many a [chocolate Silk soy milk](https://www.safeway.com/shop/product-details.960129791.html?cmpid=ps_swy_noc_ecom_goo_20200924_71700000073391208_58700006945663624_92700062511791389&gclid=Cj0KCQjwm9yJBhDTARIsABKIcGZy7_bN7X-9Pb72vw9Wp2lP2h19d-61sSYnrULWz5YTY0UbeYdLIWcaAgYnEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) carton. There's a barbeque where we cooked _way_ too much food, and we took Momo on tons of nearby hikes.

The pictures on Airbnb do it more justice than I ever could, so I won't include them here, but I will say if you get a chance to visit, don't forget to visit the hummingbirds. Michael and Kitty have set up an amazing hummingbird feeder that feeds literally _thousands_ of hummingbirds a day. They also have a super cute cat and dog that MoMo was _dying_ to play with. The cat was incredibly brave and didn't care at all, but the dog absolutely was not having it and stayed as far away from MoMo as possible.

Oh, and MoMo saw chickens for the first time. She was very confused.
