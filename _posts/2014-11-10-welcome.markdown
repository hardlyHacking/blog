> [T]he only difference between science and screwing around is when you write it down.

<cite>Adam Savage, Myth Busters</cite>

This is the third blog I've tried in as many years. Inevitably, the excitement that causes me to want to blog fizzles out, and it ends up becoming a chore. But, with a little inspiration from Mr. Savage, I've decided to give it another shot.

Time seems to fly by on the internet, and every weekend I discover some new technology or TV show or book that has me all fired up, and before I know it, it's Monday. So rather than losing all these weekends to my horrible memory, I've decided to keep a memoir of my random adventures and musings in the form of this blog. This way, I may someday revisit and chuckle at how silly and young I was.

Also, I'd be lying if I said that the software platform I'm using didn't have something to do with it. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is cool as heck - even for non-developers, they've made it dead simple to set up, and the interface is incredibly clean. These people really have an eye for design. Writing posts has never been easier.

My first blog was on Blogger, and the second was a self-hosted version I made myself using [Lightpaper](http://www.ashokgelal.com/lightpaper-for-mac/), the popular Markdown application for Mac and Python Flask. Between Blogger's horrifying themes and the work I had to do to make my own self-hosted blog look nice, I simply ended up giving up... Until one bored Saturday, I stumbled upon this on Hacker News.

This time around, I'll end up publicizing my blog more through the normal social channels, to pressure me into actually writing once in a while.

Lastly, publishing my thoughts to the world where everyone can see forces me to be rigorous, which I like. In case you missed it, [most of us](http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/how-social-media-have-created-echo-chambers-for-ideas) are [immmersed](http://blog.chron.com/intheloop/2014/08/the-new-echo-chamber-social-media/) in [echo chambers](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-05/1/online-stubbornness), where we [only hear things with which we already agree](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/01/online_echo_chambers_a_study_of_250_million_facebook_users_reveals_the_web_isn_t_as_polarized_as_we_thought_.html), which leads to [sloppy thinking](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/21/barack-obama-and-the-psychology-of-the-birther-myth/the-echo-chamber-effect). My views are *really* odd, so my hope is that by publishing them into the wild, between the hate mail and name-calling, I'll find legitimate opposing points of view.

Finally, a little bit about myself. I'm employed in the San Francisco area as a software engineer (surprise, surprise). My hobbies include teaching, coaching debate, dabbling with video games, writing, and climbing.
