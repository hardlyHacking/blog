I recently went ["glamping"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glamping) in Yosemite with Autocamp - an experience that I definitely recommend for everyone at least once. Check out their [gallery](https://autocamp.com/gallery/) for instagram-worthy pictures.

There's something pretty amazing to sleeping in a tiny enclosed space, and the Airstreams have everything a budding minimalist needs or wants. They're decorated with great industrial furniture pieces that have all been chosen with care to work in a very small space. The bathroom is what you'd expect from a luxury campsite, and the site itself has a gorgeous pond around which all the trailers are placed.

Plus, they also have cats! Sometimes. It's not really clear whose cat this is üòÖ

Each trailer has its own fire pit along with a mini kitchen stocked with plenty of pots and pans to create any meal one would desire, and I was very impressed with [High Country Health Foods](https://www.google.com/maps/place/High+Country+Health+Foods/@37.4931261,-120.00948,13z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sgrocery+store!3m4!1s0x8096b9fdee869da5:0x9f87a50ae9d07ed!8m2!3d37.4931261!4d-119.9744611), which had every brand name vegan substitute I could ask for - and some I didn't know existed!

We were in Yosemite for two days prior to booking Autocamp, and having a luxury camping experience after two days of rather strenuous hikes was _absolutely_ the right choice. On our first day alone we hiked over 11 miles with ~4000 feet of elevation gain. I didn't know "glamping" was a thing until a coworker recommended it to me, but I'd definitely it once more after this!
