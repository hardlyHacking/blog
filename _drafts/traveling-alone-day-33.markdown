title: 'Traveling Alone: The Final Post'
---

I'm going to make a new post that, by the time I write the next day, will be copy pasted into the larger "Traveling Alone" post. The reason for this is so that people following along on RSS feeds will get updates on their favorite clients, but at the same time, if someone comes into my home page, they won't just see 30 different posts (one for each day) of nothing but traveling. So I'll periodically merge the new days' posts into the older one.

##Day 33: Stonehenge and Bath

The 

##Day 34: Oxford

New Year's was pretty cool. Ben and I met up 
Ended up going home *very* late.

##Day 35: New Year's Day

Did absolutely nothing. Went to bed, woke up, had a meal, went back to bed, woke up, had another meal, and wrote my blog periodically. So many pictures to choose from ```>.<```

##Day 36: Last Day!

Was definitely feeling ready to go home today. I ended up wandering around various neighborhoods, taking random Tube stops and just walking around. Had a pretty cool veggie burger at this hipster English place, and just walked into random stores. Didn't actually buy anything, but it was pretty fun wandering around.

##Day 37: Back to America

Woke up *way* too early. My sleep schedule is totally thrown off; was up at 4, couldn't go back to sleep, so I ended up just checking out of the hostel and going to the tube early... only to find out it didn't open for another hour or so.

One McDonalds breakfast later, I find I still have 45 minutes spare time. Luckily the night buses are still operating, so I end up taking the bus to King's Cross station, which has a straight tube to the airport.

Halfway through I decide to take the express just for fun (how often am I going to do this again?). For those who don't know, the express is basically non-stop privately run train that makes it to Heathrow in 15 minutes. Pretty neat actually.

Once I got to Heathrow, checking in was a breeze, and I spent a couple hours in various bookstores. I ended up buying a notebook and pen so I could write down some thoughts. Heathrow is a great airport, and I had quite a good time actually.

Eventually met up with Daniel and we nerded out about Star Wars for a couple hours before the flight.

The flight was *packed*. Not a single spare seat. Totally different from the starting flight, but then again, it was the Sunday after New Year's before everyone started work and school, so what else could be expected.

Flight was smooth overall. Said bye to Daniel after customs and took Bart back home! Didn't even pick up the cats until the next day. I was so tired I just plopped into bed and slept.

Not a bad trip! ```:D```
