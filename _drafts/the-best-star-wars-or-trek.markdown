There are of course, far too many in both series to compare.

The original Star Trek with Shatner (3 seasons), the animated series (2 seasons), the Next Generation with Patrick Stewart (7 seasons), Deep Space Nine (6 seasons), Voyager (7 seasons), Enterprise (4 seasons), and now a newly rebooted Discovery.

The original Star Trek series is *historic*, to say the least. Shatner's performance is accompanied by an incredible cast, and the ethos really carries through fantastically. The characters are actually very interesting, and they have a depth to them that's explored in each of the various plot lines. At the heart of each character is a tension that's pulling each in multiple directions: Spok is both human and Vulcan; Kirk's most important responsibility is to the ship and his crew, even if it's at the expense of himself or in violation of Star Fleet Command; McCoy has taken an oath to never take a life, and yet, to save others, often times he must do just that. Each episode is a documentary of virtually unrelated but fascinating situations humans could find in deep space, and this is both the credit and downfall of Star Trek. To the hard core science nerds, Star Trek is of course much more realistic. Everything described could somehow be *possible* under our known laws of physics, from Silicon based life forms to scientific explanations for teleportation. But at the end of the day, while the characters go through many episodes of brief explorations, they never  *advance*. There is no notion of a season finale, or even a season opener. There is no growth or storylines or character arcs. Instead, it's just
