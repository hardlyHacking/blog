Ahoy there! You've stumbled upon one of the more useless but entertaining blogs out on the internet `:)`

Should you desire a more minute-by-minute update system, you may find me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/chander).
Before you ask, I did indeed have a battle to the death with all the other Chander's to get Twitter supremacy.

If you're a Dartmouth student trying to find old CS notes on CS1 or CS50, shame on you.
Also, you can find them [here](https://cs1.notablog.xyz/) and [here](https://cs50.notablog.xyz/).

Somewhere between [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview), [Github](https://github.com/hardlyHacking), and the Twitter datacenters, you can find all the code I've ever written. Probably.
